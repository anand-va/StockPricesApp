# StockPricesApp

Stock Prices App
The main purpose of this project is to create a simple data app and run it on the cloud.

The app downloads and displays stock price data based on user inputs. The tool for getting the data is the pandas-datareader module.

The app is created using Streamlit and run in the local machine first.

The final step is to run the app on an AWS EC2 instance.

I have written blog posts that explain how to create and run the app both in the local machine and on the cloud.
